=================

It's unclear how the multiple cursors should interact. Intuitively, we want the current cursor to 'move' while the other cursors 'remain in place'. However, there is no simple, general-purpose way to do that, since we are attempting to have no bias as to the direction of a cursor.

some other questions:
- should cursors save their direction, or leave it up to the user's 'mode'
